# Project Cursor Rules

This file contains project-specific development rules and guidelines.
These rules will be automatically applied when working in this project with Cursor.

## Design Pattern: ---

## Visual Style

### Color Palette:
- **Primary Background:** Deep charcoal #181A20 (main canvas), with a subtle dot grid texture overlay.
- **Surface/Panel:** Slightly lighter charcoal #22242C for sidebars, panels, and cards.
- **Accent Colors:** Neon green #3DFF7F (node highlights and connection points), electric blue #2F87FF (active/selected state), bright yellow #FFC24B (notification/alert icon).
- **Text Colors:** High-contrast white #FFFFFF for primary text, muted gray #A0A3AD for secondary/label text, and dimmer gray #5C5F6E for placeholder or disabled states.
- **Borders/Dividers:** Low-opacity white/gray #31343C or #2B2D36 for subtle separation.
- **Other Accents:** Occasional pastel gradients for user avatars in the top-right (rainbow spectrum: #56CCF2, #2F80ED, #9B51E0, #F2994A, #F2C94C).
- **Button States:** Blue #2F87FF for active, #22242C for default/inactive, with lighter overlays on hover.

### Typography & Layout:
- **Font Family:** Rounded, modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro Display, or similar).
- **Weights:** Medium (500) for headings, Regular (400) for body, SemiBold (600) for emphasis or key labels.
- **Hierarchy:** Large, bold section titles; medium-sized node/device labels; smaller, lighter secondary info.
- **Spacing:** Generous padding (24-32px on panels), compact vertical spacing (8-12px) between related items, consistent 16px grid for alignment.
- **Alignment:** Strong left alignment for lists/panels, centered alignment for node diagrams.

### Key Design Elements

#### Card Design:
- **Styling:** Rounded corners (12-16px radius), subtle inner shadows, and soft drop shadows (#00000033, 8-16px blur) for elevation.
- **Borders:** Minimal/no visible borders; separation achieved via shadows and contrasting backgrounds.
- **Hover States:** Slightly brighter background and soft glow effect on hover/active.
- **Hierarchy:** Card titles bolded, content clearly grouped with spacing and visual cues.

#### Navigation:
- **Patterns:** Horizontal top bar for global actions; vertical sidebar with icon-only navigation, highlighted by subtle background on active item.
- **Sidebar:** Rounded, floating appearance with icons in white or muted gray, active icon in neon green or blue.
- **Active States:** Glowing/neon ring or solid background behind active navigation items.
- **Expandable Elements:** Minimal, only visible when in use (e.g., simulation panel collapse/expand).

#### Data Visualization:
- **Chart Styles:** Node-link diagrams with curved neon lines (green/blue) connecting rounded device nodes.
- **Colors:** Active nodes glow in blue, inactive in gray; connection points highlighted in green.
- **Visual Treatments:** Minimalist, schematic-style diagrams with icons and labels; event lists use compact rows with pill-shaped protocol tags.
- **Patterns:** Grid overlays for reference; clear visual mapping between list items and diagram nodes.

#### Interactive Elements:
- **Buttons:** Rounded rectangles, solid fill (charcoal or blue), white iconography, subtle glowing effect on hover.
- **Form Elements:** Rounded input fields, high-contrast placeholder text, clear focus/active states with neon-blue borders.
- **Interactive States:** Soft glow or color shift on hover/click, ripple or shadow effects for feedback.
- **Micro-interactions:** Animation on play/pause controls, real-time highlighting of active nodes/events.

### Design Philosophy
This interface embodies:
- A bold, futuristic, and highly readable aesthetic, leveraging dark mode with neon accents for clarity and energy.
- Minimalist, utilitarian principles focused on reducing visual clutter while maximizing information density and legibility.
- Rounded corners and soft shadows create an approachable, contemporary feel, balancing professionalism with a touch of playfulness.
- The user experience prioritizes speed and focus, allowing power users to parse complex data at a glance, with strong visual hierarchy and interactive feedback guiding workflows.
- Visual strategy ensures that actionable elements stand out while background elements recede, supporting efficient multitasking and confident control.

Ensure all implementations align with this pattern's best practices.

## Tech Stack Requirements

- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite with SWC plugin
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 with CSS custom properties
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations:** Motion library (NOT framer-motion)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Notifications:** Sonner

## Critical Setup Rules

1. **ALWAYS run `npm install` before any build commands**
2. Use Motion library for animations, NOT framer-motion
3. Import Inter font in index.css
4. Use Tailwind v3 with tailwind.config.js (not CSS-based config)
5. Use `@/` path aliases for imports
6. Use Shadcn components instead of custom UI components

## Code Style

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative patterns (avoid classes)
- Favor iteration and modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Structure: exported components, subcomponents, helpers, types
- Minimize `useEffect` and `useState`; favor React Server Components where possible

## API Layer Pattern

- Centralize API calls in `src/api/` directory
- Use Axios with interceptors for auth and error handling
- Create React Query hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Implement proper error handling with toast notifications
- Use TypeScript types for all API responses

# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text
- Confetti or celebration animations for actions

### Interactive Elements
**Engage users:**
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Sliders and range controls
- Toggle switches with animations
- Progress steps with animations
- Expandable/collapsible sections
- Tabs with slide indicators
- Image comparison sliders
- Interactive demos or playgrounds

---

## Consistency Rules

### Maintain Consistency
**What should stay consistent:**
